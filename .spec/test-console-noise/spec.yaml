title: "Reduce console noise during tests"
version: "1.0.0"
status: "draft"

description: |
  Test runs currently print expected stderr/stdout from modules that intentionally log (e.g. Telegram
  notification failures, winning/deposit non-fatal errors). This is useful in production but noisy in CI
  and local test output. Configure the test runner to silence console output without changing runtime behavior.

given_when_then:
  - given: "Modules may log to console for non-fatal errors"
    when: "The Vitest suite runs"
    then: "Console output is silenced to keep test output clean"

  - given: "Some tests assert console methods were called"
    when: "Console output is silenced"
    then: "Console calls are still observable via spies/mocks (silencing affects output only)"

acceptance_tests:
  - id: TEST-LOGGING-001
    desc: "Vitest runs with console output silenced"
    criteria:
      - "vitest run does not print module logs to stdout/stderr by default"
      - "Existing tests remain green"
