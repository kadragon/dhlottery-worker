title: "Document or remove unused getAccountInfo() method"
priority: low
phase: 1

given_when_then:
  - given: "DHLotteryClient.getAccountInfo() is defined but never called"
    when: "buy.ts and charge.ts call getAccountInfo() directly (bypassing client)"
    then: "the client method becomes dead code violating facade pattern"

  - given: "we need to clarify the intention"
    when: "we either remove it or document its purpose"
    then: "the API contract becomes clear"

acceptance_tests:
  - id: TEST-REFACTOR-P1-DOC-001
    desc: "decision should be made: remove method OR add JSDoc comment explaining it's for external use"

  - id: TEST-REFACTOR-P1-DOC-002
    desc: "if removed, all references should be checked (none expected)"

  - id: TEST-REFACTOR-P1-DOC-003
    desc: "if kept, JSDoc should explain: 'Public API for external callers (internal code calls directly)'"

notes: |
  Location: src/dhlottery/client.ts:36-38
  Impact: Clarifies API contract
  Effort: 5 minutes
  Risk: None (either documentation or safe removal)

  Recommendation: Keep with JSDoc comment explaining it's intended for external API
